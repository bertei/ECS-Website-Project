# Dockerize Personal Static Website utilizing ECS

### Project Introduction:
This project takes inspiration from my previous [CloudResume-Challenge](https://github.com/bertei/CloudResumeChallenge), where I created my personal website utilizing AWS Services like S3, CDN, AGW, DDB, Lambda, R53 and more. This time around I tried to dockerize it utilizing AWS services like ECR, ECS Fargate, VPC. Also, I made two GH Action workflows, one for the Terraform deployment and the other for the ECS image deployment.
